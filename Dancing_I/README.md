Build Instruction
   1	How to Build.  Tell us what to do to get your stuff to build here.  Give us step-by-step instructions.
	- this project (.xcodeproj) is built on Xcode. For the submission, the entire project has been included, including this readme.txt. The only file for coding is mp1.cpp, which has an additional header file for extra variables. 

   2    What changes to make to the build configuration. Tell us exactly what build settings need to change, if any, to get things to run on our systems.  These changes should be SIMPLE changes to build paths and build environment variables ONLY.
	⁃	Preferably on mac for it to work, since Xcode is more compatible with it.

   3    How to run your program.  Give us step-by-step instructions to run your program here.
	⁃	First run the program by compiling the file. 
	⁃	There are several motions we can make with this exe.: moving around by side to side, dancing, or rotating.
	⁃	If press ‘q’, it will show the instructions on which keys would command which moves.
	⁃	press v—it will show how the vertices are connected and how the ‘triangles’ were made
	⁃	press t—it will move around side to side, like sliding
	⁃	press r—it will rotate 90 degrees.
	⁃	press d—it will start to dance crazy (depends on how you define crazy, but seems crazy to me enough.)
	⁃	press esc—the window will be closed
	⁃	if pressed once, it will make motion. If you’d like to pause it, then press the same button again.
