Build Instruction
   1	How to Build.  Tell us what to do to get your stuff to build here.  Give us step-by-step instructions.
	- this project (.xcodeproj) is built on Xcode. For the submission, the entire project has been included, including this readme.txt. The only file for executive coding is mp2.cpp, which has additional header files for extra variables (mountain.h, keyboards.h, airplane.h, rendering.h). 

   2    What changes to make to the build configuration. Tell us exactly what build settings need to change, if any, to get things to run on our systems.  These changes should be SIMPLE changes to build paths and build environment variables ONLY.
	⁃	Preferably on mac for it to work, since Xcode is more compatible with it.

   3    How to run your program.  Give us step-by-step instructions to run your program here.
	⁃	First run the program by compiling the file. 
	⁃	There are several motions we can make with this exe.: moving around by side to side, dancing, or rotating.
	⁃	press -: sea level decreases
	⁃	press + or =: sea level increases
	⁃	press e: resolution of mountain increases
	⁃	press d: resolution of mountain decreases
	-	press f : speed (fast)
	-	press s : speed (slow)
	⁃	press ← : roll right
	⁃	press → : roll left
	⁃	press ↑ : pitch up
	⁃	press ↓ : pitch down
	-	press F1 : turn left
	-	press F2 : turn right
	⁃	press esc—the window will be closed
	⁃	the plane would continue to move.
	- 	if the speed is going less and less, the vector of plane would eventually go to back, which allows the plane to go rear side.
